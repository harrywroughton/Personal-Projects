# Personal-Projects
Personal projects outside of my HyperionDev course.

slot_machine_program.py - This program acts as a mock slot machine, akin to one you might find in a casino / on a fruit machine. For ease of read, the code has been broken up into workable defined functions.

computer_quiz.py - This program is centred around a 4 questions quiz with the primary use of if and else statements, as well as a score counting system. As the user goes through the quiz, they will score a point for each question they get correct which will be totalled and given to the user at the end of the game.
